/* 
  BUG #1 — Effect Issue 

  This component uses useState and useEffect to update a value.
  The effect is running on every render, which causes the
  component to behave incorrectly.
  */

import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

export default function BugEffectLoop() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }, []);

  return <p>Bug 1 Count: {count}</p>;
}

// Explanation:
// We had to set dependency array [].
// In this assignment it has to be empty to run setCount just 1 time on mount.
// Without setting [DA] we get into infinite re-renderiring loop due to setCount that triggers new render.
